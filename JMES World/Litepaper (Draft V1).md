#JMES World Litepaper (Draft V1)

Democratizing Art

OVERVIEW
JMES World is a blockchain-based Art DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that
brings together a community of Artists, Art Collectors and Consumers, spanning both the
physical and digital Art worlds and backed by its own crypto-currency ($JMES) thatâ€™s maintained
by the Core Team in Berlin (JMES World GmbH).
JMES World provides a decentralized "stock market" for Art where anyone can buy both
physical and digital Art fractionally via the $JMES blockchain.
Users can also subscribe to unique cultural experiences that connect Artists and
Collectors/Consumers both physically and virtually (via NFTs that are tradable via the
blockchain).
Artworks locked into $JMES also have a subsidiary market of consumables/merch linked via
NFTs, such as Fashion items that enable users to wear their Art and prove membership / gain
access to spaces and events using embedded NFCs.
Artists and Art projects can get funded directly from the blockchain via a Governance system to
enable them to work and create Art for the $JMES market via rewards based on voting by
existing $JMES holders each month, with all incentives aligned to empower Artists to create and
connect them directly with their audiences.
Everything within the ecosystem (and all Art produced) is monetized using $JMES (via whole
and fractional NFTs) to encourage a circular economy between Producers and Consumers (i.e.
Artists and their Collectors / Customers). Anyone can create Smart Contracts on-chain to
enable various incentive streams to be innovated, with all subsequent economic activity and
value locked in $JMES with the goal to make it the de facto Art currency.
The initial focus of JMES is on graphical Art and related Fashion, but the aim is to grow to
encompass all forms of Art such as Music, Design, Aesthetics, Culinary experiences as
community demand dictates.
The ultimate goal of JMES World is to democratize Art by establishing the world's largest
decentralized Art Community, fractionally owned by the people creating and enjoying the Art
themselves, enabling everyone to create, collect and enjoy all forms of Art, without permission,
trust or borders.

PHYSICAL LAYER
JMES is built on a physical layer of Spaces that host Art-centric cultural events called
Experiences that bring together free-minded and creative people who want to learn about,
appreciate, enjoy, consume and own Art in all its aesthetic forms.
Public spaces are provided such as Community Museums (exhibiting fractionalized community
Art), Food Courts (social culinary experiences), Community Shops (selling community Art,
Fashion and merch), that require only proof of community membership to gain entry (signing
from a wallet containing a quantity of $JMES, which can be acquired at the location itself).
Exclusive Collector Spaces such as Clubhouses (containing meeting spaces, lounges, bars,
restaurants), Nightclubs (for parties and music events), Arthouses (similar to Clubhouses but
with accommodation for extended stays and interaction with Artists) are available to Collectors
depending on their grading (proved by signing from a wallet containing a Collector NFT).
Creator Spaces are also available to members producing Art or services into the DAO's
ecosystem (proved by signing from a wallet containing an Artist or Contributor NFT) and are
focused on incubating creativity and networking and for onboarding and empowering new and
promising Artists to JMES World.
All entry fees and commerce within JMES's physical spaces will be conducted using the $JMES
token, so users can onboard/acquire the token on-site if they don't have it, and then spend/earn
it for all economic activities within the locations. This is to drive adoption of $JMES as the de
facto currency for Art in the community and promote a circular economy of production and
consumption within the ecosystem.
DIGITAL LAYER
The Digital layer of JMES World is an ecosystem of online platforms built on the $JMES
Blockchain. As essentially an open-source and decentralized database, the $JMES blockchain
enables the trustless representation and verification of memberships, Art ownership and sales,
direct funding and incentives for Artists (via the token's distribution model), as well as the
$JMES currency itself, which is used for all transactions involving value within the on-chain
ecosystem, by end-users signing transactions from their own wallets.
Users access the Digital layer directly from their wallets via transactions or via Platforms that 3rd
parties integrate to the blockchain with individual usecases and USP, such as fractional Art
marketplaces, Governance portals, or sites to help educate and onboard users to enjoy Art.
The Core Team hosts the "Official" platform at JMESWorld.com, which is the default landing and
onboarding page for the Digital layer, although anyone can create alternatives if they want.

Democratizing Art

The JMESWorld site provides a Marketplace frontend for the fractionalization of Art onto the
blockchain by Artists, the buying/selling of fractions and the discovery of all physical and digital
Art locked on the $JMES blockchain, plus onboarding to new users (acquiring $JMES tokens
and wallets), Governance functions such as creating funding proposals and voting, and entry to
JMES's virtual-world experiences such as the Metaverse app, in which Artists are allocated
exclusive Spaces that can also be bought and sold via the blockchain.
DAO
$JMES is an ERC20 based fungible token (100 billion units with 9 decimals called Nils) with an
initial distribution of [20%] to the Core Team for use in the ICO (Art and fiat), airdrops, team
operation and incentives, development, events hosting, marketing and activation activities.
The remaining [80%] are minted into the community via a [2.5%] distribution each month (based
on block production rates and halving every 12 months) via a Governance system, where
$JMES holder can propose funding ideas and have the newly minted tokens distributed to the
top proposals voted on by other $JMES holders each cycle.
This means that the entire distribution of $JMES is based on aligning incentives that add value
to the ecosystem in a decentralized way to maximize its value and longevity; sub-DAOs can be
created as organizations that are funded from the blockchain based on votes from the
community that reflect each DAOs ongoing ROI, and the ecosystem can function as a
competitive marketplace to grow itself.
To support the circular-economy within the ecosystem, many innovations in terms of
incentive-streams can be implemented using smart contracts tied to the governance system; for
example, users can vote to fund certain Artists or Art projects, and receive an ROI (either
directly or burned from the coin supply) on consecutive Art sales by the Artists. Many such
mechanisms can be tried and tested to help grow the $JMES ecosystem's economic activity.
The Core Team, which has "Official" status within the DAO (and can delegate that to other
elements as needed) will move towards full decentralization over time, with its income ultimately
coming entirely from the blockchain and associated revenue streams, and meaning it will end up
being fully be owned and governed by the community itself to prevent centralization.
ACTIVATION
The strategy for activation of JMES world is centered around adding value to the physical layer
in the form of initially locking / fractionalizing well-known Art and onboarding Hero Artists, and
then using the physical infrastructure to bootstrap the digital layer to grow membership, token
adoption and economic activity. Initial activation steps are as follows:

Democratizing Art

1. Launch of the $JMES blockchain and Platform, including initial distribution to the
Core Team and launching the "official" JMESWord.com website that enables Art
fractionalization, Collector memberships and $JMES Token onboarding
2. PR & Marketing to raise awareness for our goals to democratize, decentralize and
disrupt the Art world and how we will activate the Community on both layers.
3. Initial Coin Offering (ICO) using the Core Team's $JMES distribution to offer coins into
the market for initial liquidity & market making and secondly to lock high-value physical
Artworks from well-known Artists onto the $JMES blockchain for fractional sale to
members. The Art is sold for $JMES tokens at an agreed ICO price to the Core Team,
who then fractionalize it on the blockchain and transfer the Art for physical exhibition at
the first Community Museum in Berlin.
4. Opening of the Community Museum for public exhibition at a high foot-traffic location
in Berlin; Anyone can enter the museum's lobby, but to view exhibits they need to pay a
small fee in $JMES (e.g. $1). Also in the lobby will be ways to acquire $JMES token,
e.g. using fiat or from a Faucet which would give each unique user e.g. $2 worth of
$JMES, which they can use to enter the museum and also retain a $JMES holding (and
consequently be onboarded members of the community) when they leave. Note the
same strategy will apply to all Public spaces to convert users into members.
5. Limited onboarding of exclusive Artists and Collectors to the community
a. Offering free Artist membership (NFTs) to middle-tier Hero artists, who can each
"invite" (mint NFTs for an additional) [3] artists they choose. The membership
also confers ownership of an exclusive space in JMES's physical and digital
layers and access to $JMES markets, plus an airdropped amount of $JMES
tokens for use in the ecosystem and Governance systems.
b. Selling Collector membership subscriptions (NFTs) that give access to exclusive
spaces and events.

6. Hosting a series of events to entertain the community such as Fashion shows,
concerts, DJ gigs, digital Art exhibitions to promote and drive adoption by Artists,
Collectors and Members (general users of the $JMES token).
7. Opening the Proposals system to allow Community members to form sub-DAOs
funded from the blockchain to flesh-out and grow the ecosystem including launching of
Art Incubators to onboard mainstream on both the physical and digital layers.
8. Expanding the Physical layer by helping to promote and replicate the initial physical
spaces globally, providing the revenue and funding streams necessary to make them
profitable for the 3rd parties who want to invest in creating and hosting them profitably.
In the long term, we will drive growth by enabling any talented Artists to earn a living and sell
their works to a mainstream community of $JMES users who can easily discover, fractionally
own and enjoy the resulting Art produced in both the physical and digital layers. For Collectors,
we will provide the best experiences to enjoy the exclusive Art, connections to Artists and
networking with other Collectors that the subscription brings.
